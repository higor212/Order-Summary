## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Adobe XD

### What I learned

In this project, I learn new properties to break words in CSS, and more concepts to responsive development.

### Continued development

From that project, I could see my evolution in CSS again, but this time it reaches another level that I'm very grateful.
